I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I am also a member of [Internet and Mobile Computing Laboratory (IMCL)](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html) lead by [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/). 


I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), and very fortunate to work with my supervisor Professor [Cho-Li Wang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~clwang/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

Recent Opening! 
======
If you are interested in **large-scale models (LLMs) fine-tuning and inference optimization**, we are actively looking for motivated colleagues/students at different levels (Postdoc, PhD, MSc, Undergraduate, etc.) to reach out and join us!

Currently, we have 3 position openings for the **Capstone Project** related to LLM and LLM inference, which will collaborate with the industry. Welcome to reach out and join us! We will provide hands-on guidance for your work!


Research Interests:
======
<h3> AI Infrastructure, MLSys, LLMs: </h3>

**Large-Scale Model (LLMs) Training, Fine-Tuning, Checkpointing, and Inference Optimization.** I am broadly interested in the building and optimization of AI systems (MLSys) from both sides of the system and machine learning algorithms based on a wide range of computing platforms (e.g., distributed, cloud, HPC, IoT, AIoT, and even quantum and photonic platforms) for emerging big data and AI applications, including distributed communication optimization, data compression, fault-tolerance, etc.

<h3> HPC, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing: </h3>

I am also interested in high-performance computing (HPC), distributed systems, data reduction, cloud computing, fault tolerance, and FPGA.

<!-- which is an interdisciplinary research area relevant to distributed systems, distributed optimization, stochastic optimization, and machine learning/deep learning that aims to optimize the distributed deep learning system from both sides of the system and machine/deep learning algorithms, like distributed communication reduction, gradient error constraints, and deep learning compilation optimization, etc. -->


<!--We have several projects related to **large-scale models (LLMs) fine-tuning and inference optimization** recruiting students to join, including the **PhD student and other levels**. You are welcome to reach out and talk to me! We will provide hands-on guidance for your work! 

We also have lots of **industry connections in both China and America** and can support you to find some **excellent industry intern opportunities**!

If you are interested in my research, we are actively looking for motivated colleagues/students at different levels to reach out and join us!

Currently, We are looking for student interns who would like to work with us in the area of Machine Learning Systems (MLSys). Students who want to spend several months in HK for your Final Year Project (“毕业设计”) are also welcome to reach out with your CV. We welcome different-level students to reach out. -->
